ğŸ“Œ Exercise 8: Compare Wrapper and Primitive Performance

ğŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that:
1.	Loops 10 million times, adding numbers using primitive int.
2.	Loops 10 million times, adding numbers using wrapper class Integer.
3.	Prints the time taken for both cases.

ğŸ”¹ Expected Output:
```text
Time taken using int: 30 ms
Time taken using Integer: 120 ms
```
ğŸ”¹ Hint: Use System.nanoTime() to measure time.
