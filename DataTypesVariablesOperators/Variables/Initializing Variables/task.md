After declaring a variable, we must assign a value to it before using it. This is called initialization. It’s like putting a book inside the ‘books’ box.

```jshelllanguage
age = 25;        // Assigning 25 to the 'age' variable
price = 19.99; // Assigning a decimal value to 'price'
name = "Alice"; // Assigning text to 'name'
```
