# Declaring and Initializing Variables in Java 🏗️

Imagine you’ve just moved into a new house.

You have **empty storage boxes** labeled for different things—one for books, one for clothes, one for gadgets. Before you can use them, you need to **put something inside**.

In Java, **variables** work just like those storage boxes. They store different types of information—numbers, text, true/false values—and we need to **declare** them (create the box) and **initialize** them (put something inside). Let’s break it down!"

---

## **Declaring a Variable – Creating the Box 📦**

"In Java, before using a variable, we must **declare it**—this means telling Java what type of data it will store. The syntax looks like this:"

```
dataType variableName;
```

```jshelllanguage
int age;     // Declares a variable 'age' to store an integer
double price; // Declares a variable 'price' to store a decimal number
String name; // Declares a variable 'name' to store text
```

## **Initializing a Variable – Putting Something Inside 🎁**

“After declaring a variable, we must assign a value to it before using it. This is called initialization. It’s like putting a book inside the ‘books’ box.”

```jshelllanguage
age = 25;        // Assigning 25 to the 'age' variable
price = 19.99; // Assigning a decimal value to 'price'
name = "Alice"; // Assigning text to 'name'
```

## **Declaring and Initializing in One Step**

“We can also declare and initialize a variable in the same step—just like buying a new box and immediately putting something inside it!”

```jshelllanguage
int score = 100;
double price = 19.99; 
String name = "Alice";
boolean isPassed = true;  
```

### Note: If uninitialized, variables have a default value
`String` --> `null`  
`int` --> `0`  
`double` --> `0.0`  
`boolean` --> `false`


## **Rules for Naming Variables – Java’s House Rules! 🏠**

“Just like addresses help locate houses, variable names must follow certain rules:

✅ Must start with a letter, _, or $

✅ Can contain letters, digits, _, and $

✅ Case-sensitive (Age and age are different!)

✅ Cannot use Java keywords (like int, class, public)

❌ 2price (Cannot start with a number)

❌ my variable (No spaces allowed)

❌ class (Reserved keyword)

😊 Should be meaningful (best practice)

😊 lowerCamelCase for readability (best practice)
* variables: firstName, accountBalance
* constants: final int MAX_USERS = 100; (all caps with underscore)
