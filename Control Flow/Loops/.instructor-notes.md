# Mastering Loops in Java for the OCA Java SE Exam

## The Story of Alex and the Looping Enigma

Alex, an aspiring Java developer, is preparing for the Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE exam. One day, while practicing coding exercises, Alex encounters a recurring problem: how to execute a block of code multiple times efficiently? Enter loops—the magical constructs in Java that help repeat actions effortlessly.

As Alex explores different types of loops, a wise mentor guides them through the labyrinth of loop structures in Java. Let's join Alex on this journey of mastering loops.

## Understanding Loops

Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times without writing redundant statements. Java provides several loop structures:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- `enhanced for` loop

Each type of loop serves a specific purpose, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses is crucial for writing efficient programs.

## The `for` Loop – Marching in Steps

Alex first encounters the `for` loop, which is useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts:

```jshelllanguage
for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly
}
```

### Example: Printing Numbers from 1 to 5

```jshelllanguage
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

Alex notices how the loop initializes `i` to 1, checks if `i <= 5`, executes the block, increments `i`, and repeats the process until the condition fails.

---

## The `while` Loop – The Vigilant Guardian

The `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations is unknown, and the loop should run as long as a condition remains true.

```jshelllanguage
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly
}
```

### Example: Counting Down from 5

```jshelllanguage
public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 5;
        while (count > 0) {
            System.out.println("Countdown: " + count);
            count--;
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
```

Alex appreciates the `while` loop for scenarios where the condition's end is uncertain.

---

## The `do-while` Loop – The One-Time Executor

The `do-while` loop ensures that the code executes at least once, even if the condition is false.

```jshelllanguage
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

### Example: Asking for User Input Until Valid

```jshelllanguage
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DoWhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;
        
        do {
            System.out.print("Enter a number greater than 10: ");
            number = scanner.nextInt();
        } while (number <= 10);
        
        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
    }
}
```

Here, the user is prompted for input at least once.

---

## The Enhanced `for` Loop – The Collector’s Choice

When working with arrays or collections, the enhanced `for` loop simplifies iteration.

```jshelllanguage
for (dataType item : collection) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

### Example: Iterating Over an Array

```jshelllanguage
public class EnhancedForExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.println("Number: " + num);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Number: 10
Number: 20
Number: 30
Number: 40
Number: 50
```

---

## Controlling Loop Execution with `break` and `continue`

### `break`: Exiting the Loop

```jshelllanguage
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) break;
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
```

### Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
```

### `continue`: Skipping an Iteration

```jshelllanguage
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) continue;
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
```

### Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

Alex now confidently understands Java loops!

> **More points to discuss:**
> * Discuss the scope of loop control variable `i`
> * Can have more than one variable in declaration and initialization part
    >   * Eg: for (int x = 10, y = 3; y > 3; y++) { }
> * Only one condition is allowed. Conditions separated by comma is not allowed.
    >   * Eg: Legal statement : `for (int x = 0; ((((x < 10) && (y-- > 2)) | x == 3)); x++) { }`
>   * Eg: compile error: `for (int x=0; (x > 5), (y<2) ; x++) { }`
