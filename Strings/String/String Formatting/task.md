# Problem Statement: Formatting a Report Table using String Formatting in Java

**Objective:**

You are working on a Human Resource Management System where you need to generate a formatted employee salary report. Your task is to display employee details in a well-structured table using Java’s printf method and format specifiers.

**Requirements:**
1.	Print a table containing employee details such as Name, Age, and Salary.
2.	Use proper column alignment:
•	Left-align the “Name” column.
•	Right-align the “Age” column.
•	Right-align the “Salary” column with two decimal places.
3.	Add a horizontal separator after the header row.
4.	Use printf() with format specifiers to ensure a clean and structured output.

**Output:**
```textmate
Name       |   Age |     Salary
-----------------------------------
Rahul      |    25 |   50000.51
Rocky      |    30 |   60000.75
Rambo      |    28 |   70000.10
