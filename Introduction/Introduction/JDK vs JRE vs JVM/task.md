Before we start coding, letâ€™s clear up a common confusion: **JDK, JRE, and JVM**.

### Imagine Youâ€™re Making a Movie...

Just like in Java development, a movie involves **different roles and components** working together.

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine) â†’ The Movie Theater ðŸŽ¥**
  - The **JVM is like a movie theater** where a film (Java program) is played.
  - It doesnâ€™t produce the movie; it just provides the environment to **watch (execute) the movie**.
  - No matter where the theater is located (**Windows, macOS, Linux**), the movie plays the same wayâ€”just like Java code runs the same on any JVM.

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment) â†’ The Movie DVD or Streaming Service ðŸ“€**
  - The **JRE is like a DVD or a streaming service (Netflix, Disney+, etc.)**.
  - It contains everything needed to **deliver and run the movie in the theater** (Java libraries, runtime components, and JVM).
  - Without the DVD or streaming service, the theater (**JVM**) wouldnâ€™t have anything to play!

- **JDK (Java Development Kit) â†’ The Movie Studio ðŸŽ¬**
  - The **JDK is like a full-fledged movie production studio**â€”it doesnâ€™t just play movies, it **creates** them!
  - It includes **cameras, editing software, scripts, actors, and directors** (Java compiler, debugger, and tools) to **write, produce, and package movies** (develop Java applications).
  - A movie studio has everything needed to **produce a DVD or a digital version** (compile Java code into a runnable program).

## How It Relates to Java Development

| Java Component | Movie Analogy ðŸŽ¬             | What It Does                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **JVM**        | The movie theater            | Runs Java programs                                    |
| **JRE**        | The DVD or streaming service | Provides necessary libraries to run Java applications |
| **JDK**        | The movie production studio  | Allows you to write, compile, and run Java programs   |

## Conclusion

"If you just want to **watch movies** (run Java programs), all you need is a **JRE** (a DVD or streaming service). But if you want to **create movies** (develop Java applications), you need a **JDK** (a full movie production studio)."

Now that you understand **JDK, JRE, and JVM**, letâ€™s install **JDK manually** and set up **IntelliJ IDEA** to start writing our first Java program! ðŸš€
