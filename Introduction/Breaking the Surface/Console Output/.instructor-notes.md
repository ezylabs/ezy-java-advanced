## Understanding Console Output – Talking to the User 🗣️

"In Java, we use `System.out.println()` to print messages to the console. Think of it as Java’s way of talking to you."

- `System.out.println("Hello, Java!");` → Prints **Hello, Java!** and moves to a new line.
- `System.out.print("Hello, ");` → Prints **Hello,** but **does not** move to a new line.
