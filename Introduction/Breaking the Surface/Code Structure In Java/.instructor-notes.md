# Java Code Structure & Building Your First Java Program 🚀

[Instructor appears on screen, smiling]

"Alright, everyone! Imagine this—you’re about to build your very first Java program. It’s like stepping into a new city for the first time. The roads, buildings, and traffic rules may seem unfamiliar at first, but once you understand the layout, you’ll be navigating like a pro.

Java has its own **rules and structure**, just like a well-planned city. And today, I’ll be your tour guide. We’ll explore how Java programs are structured, write our first program, and even build a **simple calculator**. Ready? Let’s go!"

## Java Code Structure – Understanding the Blueprint 🏗️

"Every Java program follows a **specific structure**. Think of it like a house:

- The **package** is like the neighborhood where your house (class) is located.
- The **class** is the house itself—it holds all the important things.
- The **main method** is the entrance—without it, the program won’t run.
- Inside, we write our **instructions (code)**—these are like the furniture and decorations inside the house.

Let’s look at a simple Java program:"

```java
// This is a comment - It helps explain what the code does but is ignored by Java

// Package declaration (optional, used for organizing code)
package mypackage;  

// Class declaration
public class MyFirstProgram {
    
    // The main method - This is where the program starts executing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Printing a message to the console
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```
